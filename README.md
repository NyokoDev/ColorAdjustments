# ColorAdjustments
 Fine-tune exposure, contrast, hue, and saturation.

Similar to Dynamic Resolution Extended, this mod also features a settings entry within the settings menu.

This mod utilizes algernon's Localization framework and you're more than welcome to contact me/make push request with additional changes.
Huge thanks to algernon for input.

# Usage


Find 'ColorAdjustments' section in the settings menu.
 
 Here you will find 4 sliders that allow you to change PostExposure, Contrast, HueShift and Saturation for a more pleasant look. These settings are saved. 

 Note! ColorFilter is missing due to difficulties getting the value to work, however it is planned.



The mod also includes options to import/export your own file (you must do this manually), you can change these settings in game as you would with Photo Mode.

Note: Photo Mode Preserve is NOT needed at all to make this mod work. Simply standalone.

This mod has been labelled as TEST and it's obviously not the final release. 


# How to import your own visual settings
First of all head to this location:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cities Skylines II\Cities2_Data\

If your install is different from C: simply switch that to your location instead. The mod will redirect to the currently installed directory anyway.

Obtain your .XML and place it in there replacing the older ColorAdjustments.xml then restart your game to refresh the changes.


I, Nyoko have constructed this code.
